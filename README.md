# The Genetic Code Break

## Description
The Genetic Code Break is a project that transforms and expands an existing code structure. By duplicating code elements from locations **A through F**, new variations were created and named sequentially as **A0 to F5** and **A1 through F6**. This innovative approach explores dynamic code transformation and naming patterns.

## Features
- Duplication of original code elements from locations A through F.
- Sequential naming convention for the new code versions.
- Logical and systematic organization of code segments.
- Integration with OIDC Subsystem Data Form for secure data handling.
- Built for compatibility with DOS 2.xx environments.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: [Insert the programming language used, e.g., Python, JavaScript]
